# Image_classification
This project demonstrates an Image Classification model built with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) using TensorFlow/Keras. The model is trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset consisting of 60,000 color images across 10 classes (airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck).

🚀 Features

Implemented a deep CNN architecture with Conv2D, MaxPooling, Dense, and Dropout layers.

Achieved ~78% validation accuracy on CIFAR-10 after 15 epochs.

Preprocessed data using normalization and one-hot encoding.

Tested predictions on custom images after resizing to 32×32 pixels.
